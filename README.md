# JhonWeatherApp

This Is A Test Version Of JhonWeatherApp Made In ElectronJS. 
I Made This To Benchmark The Performance/File Sizes Difference And It Is Massive To Say At The Least.

## vTauri
- 30-50MB RAM Usage
- 7MB File Size (As Of 18/08/2022)

## vElectron
- 200MB RAM Usage
- 300MB File Size

Clearly Tauri Does Better In Both Memory Usage And File Sizes. 
I Didn't Compare The CPU Usage As They Are The Same At Around 0 - 1% Usage
Not Releasing A Build As I'm Having Trouble With Packaging.

```
npm start
```
Or
```
yarn start
```
